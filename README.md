# Hangman

This is a text-based version of the letter-guessing game "Hangman", programmed in Java.

# Currently implemented features:
- You can guess one letter at a time and be shown whether you're guess was correct or incorrect.
- Error checking forces the player to put appropriate input (a single letter character).
- ASCII Hangman art gives the classic game a classic feel.
- Six (6) incorrect guesses or guessing every letter in the mystery word results in a game over.
- Winning multiple games in a row results in a streak, with the player's highest streak being shown after you choose to quit playing at the end of a game.

# Possible future features:
- Difficulty selection
- Proper, non-text-based GUI
